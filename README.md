# MARLproject

This repository contains a project on Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning that I did during the Brains, Minds, Machines Summer school in August 2022. Check the summer school [website](https://cbmm.mit.edu/summer-school) for more information (I highly recommend attending it!).

This project is based on the MARLgrid environment: [github repo](https://github.com/kandouss/marlgrid)

The episode folder contains the student-teacher interactions that were run.
The video folder contains gifs of some of those simulations for presentation purposes.

The notebook AgentMARL.ipynb contains the main script with the teacher Q-learning, and the student learning by imitation. 

The BMMproject.pdf file corresponds to the final presentation of the project.
